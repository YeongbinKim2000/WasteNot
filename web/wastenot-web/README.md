# WasteNot Community Swap Web App

This repository contains the web application for **WasteNot** – a project developed by Ethan Yan, Yeongbin Kim, and Linh Fowler at Georgia Institute of Technology (CS 4261/8802-MAS, Instructor: Matthew Sanders). WasteNot is aimed at reducing household food waste by tracking inventory, sending expiration alerts, and facilitating community-driven food sharing.

This web application specifically focuses on the **Community Swap/Donation** approach. It allows users to post surplus food items, browse available listings, and coordinate local pick-ups to help reduce waste and build community connections.

## Project Overview

Food waste is a growing concern due to over-purchasing, poor inventory management, and the lack of real-time tracking. WasteNot addresses these issues by offering multiple approaches:

- **Approach A:** Barcode/Receipt Scanning – Automates inventory entry and provides personalized recipe suggestions.
- **Approach B:** Smart Fridge Sensor (IoT) – Uses sensor data for real-time inventory tracking and automated alerts.
- **Approach C (this web app):** Community Swap/Donation – Connects neighbors to share surplus food, reducing waste and fostering community trust.

## Installation

Before starting the development server, install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!  
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!  
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
